/*
Store all data attributes into an array.
- Have a for loop to run DOM to replace elements with whats stored in each object
- in order to prevent over loading the projects and exceptions an if statement will be needed to check the size of the filteredArray
 If its greater than 6 (or 5 in indexes) have the for loop size be six, otherwise have the loops conditional be the size of the filtered array

- This also means you're gonna have to have a default array.
