# Portfolio-Site
A website I created from scratch and is being hosted on GitHub pages to display my work.

# What this site includes 
- HTML/CSS Design
- JavaScript
- Angular
- AJAX
- jQuery
- PHP
- PayPal API (allows payments)
- node.js

## Please note that the eCommerce section of the site will send payments to my PayPal account. 
I did this to show case that I can implement payments into a website. You're more than welcome to donate, but I wanted everyone to be aware of this function.
