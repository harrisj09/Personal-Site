- now center it with flexbox

- everything should happen in the Parent container, that's my tip.
The parent container, as in, the thing that wraps the about container
+----------------------------------------------+

- The box model,
  Display property
  & Position property(note: z-index); 

- For html, learn about semantic tags and the BEM naming convention
