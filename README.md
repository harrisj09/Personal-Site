# [Personal-Site](https://harrisj09.github.io/personal-site/)
 A website I created from scratch and is being hosted on GitHub pages to display my work.

## [Under a new hoster and Domain](https://jhhwebsite.netlify.com)
This is because I plan on implementing a contact form and possibly other backend technologies if needed.


 # For those who plan on using this web template.
Credit is appreciated, but not required. If you find an issue with the site create a pull request or post an issue. Explanations of code will be worked on eventually.


# Background information about the site
 The CSS proportion of the site makes use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, display property and position property in order to deliver a fully responsive site. I'd prefer not to use CSS frameworks due to the fact that all of this can accomplished without them, but I have no problem with implementing a CSS preprocessor(SASS most likely).
