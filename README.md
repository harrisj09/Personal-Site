# [Personal-Site](https://harrisj09.github.io/personal-site/)
 A website I created from scratch and is being hosted on GitHub pages to display my work. I also treat this as if it's a project being worked on by a team (even though it's just me working on it) to also show that I can use version control and GitHub.

 # What this site includes (Or plans to include)
 - HTML/CSS Design
 - JavaScript
 - Angular
 - PHP
 - node.js

# Background information about the site
 The CSS proportion of the site makes use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, display property and position property in order to deliver a fully responsive site. I'd prefer not to use CSS frameworks due to the fact that all of this can accomplished without them.

# I'm going off of this image to help direct me into the direction as to what should be learned in order to incorporate full stack web development
