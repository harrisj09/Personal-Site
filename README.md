# [Personal-Site](https://personalsiteharris.netlify.com/)
Site is in beta.


 ## For those who plan on using this web template.
Credit is appreciated, but not required. If you find an issue with the site create a pull request or post an issue. Explanations of code will be worked on eventually.


## Background information about the site
 The CSS proportion of the site makes use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, display property and position property in order to deliver a fully responsive site. I'd prefer not to use CSS frameworks due to the fact that all of this can accomplished without them, but I have no problem with implementing a CSS preprocessor(SASS most likely).


## I'm using this image to help move me into the right direction as to what should be learned for front end web development.
