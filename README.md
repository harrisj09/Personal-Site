# [Portfolio-Site](https://harrisj09.github.io/portfolio/)
 A website I created from scratch and is being hosted on GitHub pages to display my work. I also treat this as if it's a project being worked on by a team (even though it's just me working on it) to also show that I can use version control and GitHub.

 # What this site includes (Or plans to include)
 - HTML/CSS Design
 - JavaScript
 - Angular
 - PHP
 - node.js
